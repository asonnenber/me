title: "Book's Quest"
excerpt: "This capstone project is a 2D pixel art adventure game built on GameMaker and utilizes apps such as Pixelables to create the characters and background. The main character, a book named Book, realizes its friends are missing when they don’t show up at Book's house. The missing books—titles players may recognize as some of the most frequently challenged in North America—have vanished, and Book takes it upon itself to find its friends, following clues and talking to others along the way. Through gamification, this project will connect players to the emotional weight of censorship by invoking feelings of anxiety, sadness, and determination.
