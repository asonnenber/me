title: "Interpreting Women: Gendered Narratives in English Translations of Homer's Odyssey"
excerpt: "This project is a paper written using Voyant Tools and analyzes how eleven English translators of the Odyssey represent mortal women, focusing on Books 18-22, and reveals gender bias in their language choices. It centers on mortal characters: Penelope, Eurycleia, Melantho, and the serving women executed by Telemachus. The dataset consists of ten male translators and Emily Wilson, the first woman to publish an English translation of the Odyssey in 2017.

I really wanted to work on a project that combined both my undergrad and grad school courses. During my undergrad, my Classics professors taught us to always read into the bias of the author of any work whether primary or secondary. I am by no means an expert at translating Ancient Greek, but I still have an intermediate understanding of this dead language, enough so that I can understand when an English translator has taken too much creative liberty in their adaptation of a Greco-Roman work. Perhaps I few certain characters in the Odyssey differently than others due to my bias as a woman, but I still wanted to create a text analysis project from big data that I gathered and cleaned and organized myself in order to see whether or not there were clearly discernable differences between 10 English male translators of the Odyssey and the only published female English translator.
